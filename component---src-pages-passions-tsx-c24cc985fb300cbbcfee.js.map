I started with a mirrorless camera, an\nOlympus Pen E-PL6 after figuring it out that smartphones are too limited\nif you want to explore the world of photography. \nMy best shots are landscapes, but I'm pretty good at shooting portraits\nand night photography.\n\nMy current equipment is:\n\n  ▪ Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III\n  ▪ Olympus M.Zuiko 14-42mm f3.5/5.6 \n  ▪ Olympus M.Zuiko 45mm f1.8`}\n    </div>\n    <br />\n    <a\n      href=\"https://500px.com/marcotisi\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n    >\n      Checkout\n    </a>{\" \"}\n    my profile on 500 px\n    <div>\n      {`\n~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~\n\nTravelling\n\nTravelling is another passion: the first plane I took was an intercontinental\nflight from Venice to Seattle to meet with one of my dearest friend who lived\nin Washington State. I stayed for a month and we visited a lot of countries by\ntrain, bus, bicycle, foot and even hitchhiking. \nSince then, I never stop travelling.  \n\nHere is a list of countries I visited:\n\n  ▪ U.S.A.

After a month I bought a surf board and took some lessons.\nThis was one of the best choice in my life! Surfing is hard, it forces you to \nface your fears, but the first time you get up on a surf board, you feel great!\nIt's a sport that connects yourself with the ocean, the waves, the beach and\nother surfers. You feel in peace with yourself.\n\nIf you have the opportunity, I highly recommend you to try it out!\n  `}\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Passions;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
