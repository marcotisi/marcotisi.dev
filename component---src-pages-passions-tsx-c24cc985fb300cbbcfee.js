I stayed for a month and we visited a lot of countries by\ntrain, bus, bicycle, foot and even hitchhiking. \nSince then, I never stop travelling.  \n\nHere is a list of countries I visited:\n\n  ▪ U.S.A.

After a month I bought a surf board and took some lessons.\nThis was one of the best choice in my life! Surfing is hard, it forces you to \nface your fears, but the first time you get up on a surf board, you feel great!\nIt's a sport that connects yourself with the ocean, the waves, the beach and\nother surfers. You feel in peace with yourself.\n\nIf you have the opportunity, I highly recommend you to try it out!\n  "))};n.default=i}}]);
