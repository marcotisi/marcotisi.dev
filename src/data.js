  summary: `Staff Engineer with 20+ years of experience building and scaling complex web products. I specialize in modern frontend architecture (React, TypeScript, state management, observability) and in modernizing legacy systems without disrupting production.

I've led multi-cycle refactors of business-critical systems, improved reliability and debuggability of real-time applications, and acted as a technical multiplier through architecture, tooling, and mentorship. I'm particularly experienced with real-time systems, WebSockets/WebRTC, and frontend reliability in high-traffic environments.

Comfortable operating across frontend, backend, and infrastructure boundaries when needed, with a strong bias toward long-term maintainability, clarity, and disciplined delivery.`,
